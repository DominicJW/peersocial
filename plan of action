PLAN:

1. individual messages (live)
2.FINDID command reformatted to detect branches, and alternative command of own peer searching through the databases of associates
3.Scoring system
- Peer running tests, using client commands and validating output
- could have a test command, client sends test command to a server, the server evaluates the command and sends results back. Could be done to do toring, though man in middle attack is very likely

4.Permanant database saved, after computer turned off and program stopped
5.CHANGEID
6.Group messaging - quite complex
7.message logs
8.post board and profile
9.compile a facebook type feed##in order of date and score of user and likes(eventually)
10. Authentication and validation
11.different lists of Associates with different access rights: view posts, profile. Friends, Strangers
12.GUI
13. Comments and likes, with validation -quite complex
14. Multimedia

-qute complex: tooing and throwing of signals
see Group message algorithm. similar principles can be applied to all commands.
